    "   The DFS algorithm works in a manner similar to preorder traversal of the trees. like preorder traversal, internally this algorithm also uses stack.                                                                                    \n",
    "Let us consider the following example. Suppose a person is trapped inside a maze.To come out from that maze,the person visits each path and each intersection (in the worst case).Let us say the person uses two colors of paint to mark the intersections already passed. When discovering a new intersection, it is marked grey, and he continues to go deeper. \n",
    "After reaching a \"dead end\"  the person knows that there is no more unexplored path fro the grey intersection, which now is completed, and he marks it with black. this \"dead end\" is either an intersection which has already been marked grey or black, or simply a path that does not lead to an intersection. \n",
    "The intersection of the maze are the vertices and the paths between the intersections are the edges of the graph. \n",

    "   The BFS algorithm works similar to leavel-order traversal of the trees. like level-order traversal, BFS also uses queues. in fact, level-order traversal got inspired from BFS. BFS works level by level. initially, BFD starts at given vertex, which os at level 0. In the first stage it visits all verices at level 1( that means, vertices whose distance is 1 from the start vertex of the graph) in the second stages, it visits all vertices at the second level. These new vertices are the ones which are adjacent to level 1 vertices.                                                                                                                          \n",
